# What would I do to improve the server?

First, I was going to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript. I believe that TypeScript today can help us solve the vast majority of errors before the code is even executed.

Second, I would directly add a route that can bring in the desired formatting, so we don't need a script to do it. For this, perhaps a REST-like architecture (used) combined with a GraphQL route could do the job without loss of performance.

In addition, we would need to create a basic MC structure for the server to be smooth and well structured.

Also, I would add a token verification middleware so that the token is not verified on every request.

Now, about the script I developed:

I would create a more elaborate and more readable structure. In this case the functions would be separated in files by functionality.

I would also perform the task in TypeScript (this would have helped me a lot at the development time).

Maybe it would be better to develop a service/server that would respond to a request by returning formatted data and not just a script.

Also, each executed function could be used as a script through the command lines.

It would also be interesting to create a menu through the command lines to make available each functionality developed.

Finally, I am still not satisfied with the fetch part of the transaction data, but I am thinking about how to improve it.

Thanks for the test!
